about = 'After first stumbling upon NATS, I quickly fell in love with it. I had contributed to the Java client, and afterwards I just *had* to learn Go to be able to contribute to the server too! Happy to be a part of the community. <br>I am interested in distributed computing, fault tolerance, open source, being challenged during my work and having loads of fun while doing it!'
